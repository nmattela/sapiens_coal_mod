# Sapiens Coal Mod

This mod adds coal and charcoal to the game: More efficient, long-lasting fuel types.

## Installation
This mod requires Hammerstone, so please install that mod alongside this one.

## Content

Two new resources can be found: coal and charcoal. These two resources can be used to fuel campfires, kilns, and torches, and last up to 10 times longer than branches.

### Charcoal
Charcoal can be crafted by clicking on your branch storage and selecting craft. There, you can choose to craft charcoal. You will need 3 branches and a campfire, and this will return you 2 charcoals.

### Coal
Coal is randomly generated in your world. You can find it at mountains, but you should also be able to find it underground. You will need to mine coal with a pickaxe. Coal has the same properties as charcoal (at the moment).
